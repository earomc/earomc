### Hi there, I am Moritz aka earomc ðŸ‘‹

This is my "About Me" page ... if you care about that stuff ...

- I am a human! YES! Real human. Wow :O :D
- Making my own programming language. But it will take a decade until that's done.
- My interests in programming are W  I  D  E
- I do programming professionally ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž so I don't commit here all that often.

- Languages I ever used (in order of learning): Scratch, Python, Java, Lua, JavaScript, Rust, C, TypeScript, Odin, [Mo](https://molang.org/)
- Languages I want to learn (or learn more of) in order of priority: C, Zig, Odin, Kotlin, Haskell, [Uiua?!? whar?](https://www.uiua.org/)
- I started programming in Java back in 2017, started with Rust on-off in mid 2023.

- I like making neapolitan pizza and borgir.
- I used to host my own Minecraft server from 2017-2021 which is down because I don't have enough time and motivation to put into supporting it.
- Sorry ... I use Windows.

##### Weaknesses:
- front end :(
- dynamically typed languages. (i hate python, all my homies hate python)
