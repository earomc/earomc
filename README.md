### Hi there, I am Moritz aka earomc ðŸ‘‹

This is my "About Me" page. If you don't care, read something else.

- My main interest is currently in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) ðŸ¦€
- I do programming professionally ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž so I don't commit here all that often.

- I started programming in Java back in 2017, started with Rust on-off in mid 2023.
- I like making neapolitan pizza and borgir.
- I used to host my own Minecraft server from 2017-2021 which is down because I don't have enough time and motivation to put into supporting it.

##### Weaknesses:
- front end :( I don't know how to use a single JavaScript framework
- dynamically typed languages. (i hate python, all my homies hate python)
