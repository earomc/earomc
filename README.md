### Hi there, I am Moritz aka earomc 👋

This is my "About Me" page ... if you care about that stuff ...

- I am a human! YES! Real human. Wow :O :D
- Making my own programming language. But that will prolly take a decade till that's done.
- My interests in programming are mainly at developing my compiler atm, but gamedev also seems pretty fun.

- Languages I ever used (in order of learning): Scratch, Python, Java, Lua, JavaScript, Rust, C, TypeScript, Odin, [Mo](https://molang.org/)
- Languages I want to learn (or learn more of) in order of priority: C, Zig, Odin, Kotlin, Haskell, [Uiua?!? whar?](https://www.uiua.org/)
- I started programming in Java back in 2017, started with Rust on-off in mid 2023.

- I like making neapolitan pizza and borgir.
- I used to host my own Minecraft server from 2017-2021 which is down because I don't have enough time and motivation to put into supporting it.
- Fedora user 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓

##### Weaknesses:
- me no likey frontend gorbag :(
- dynamically typed, interpreted languages *schAudEr* (i hate python, all my homies hate python)
